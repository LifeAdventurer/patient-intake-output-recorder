### 1.0.0 <small>October 22, 2024</small> { id="1.0.0" }

Patient Intake/Output Recorder v1.0.0 is now live, designed to streamline patient dietary tracking in hospitals and nurse centers. This release automates recording and monitoring patient intake (food, water) and output (urination, defecation), providing accurate and real-time data synchronization between patients and monitors.

**Key Features:**

- Two-Sided Interface: Separate views for patients and monitors, enabling seamless daily intake and output tracking.
- Data Synchronization: Automatically sums and syncs data, making it easy for both patients and monitors to stay updated.
- Restriction Management: The monitor side can set custom daily intake limits for food and water, with warnings to keep patients within healthy boundaries.
- Weight Tracking: Patients can record their weight as part of the health monitoring process.
- History Tracking: All records are saved, allowing patients and monitors to view the history of dietary records and monitor progress over time.

**Tech Stack:**

- Backend: FastAPI and Uvicorn.
- Frontend: Vue and Bootstrap 5.

**Documentation:**

- Documentation is currently being developed and will be available soon.

**Development Status:**

- The project is still in active development with several open issues, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you want to help with bug fixes, new features, or improvements, we'd love your support!
